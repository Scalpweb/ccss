> CrypticCSS - A CSS-in-JS concept that brings you **true CSS mangling** with **design system capabilities**.

## WARNING!

This a work in progress project.

## Contribution

**CCSS** is trying to be a community effort, we're open to any suggestions.
However, we also sacrificed some features already for the sake of performance
and simplicity. We are having strict "rules" of what can be added. For most
cases plugins, extensions and custom props should be enough.
