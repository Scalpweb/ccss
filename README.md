> CrypticCSS - An experimental concept of **true** CSS mangling.

## WARNING!

This a work in progress project. Not even the npm packages working :)

## Install

```sh
npm i @cyptic-css/core
```

## Usage

```js
import ccss from '@cyptic-css/core'

ccss({
    d: 'f',
    ai: 's'
})

/**
 * display: block;
 * align-items: flex-start;
 */
```

For more details on usage and setup, please read our [API docs](./API.md).

## Why?

We are completely aware that it's not easy the justify the existance of
this solution. It is something that is hard to accept as a professional
developer.

On a project we started to heavily use a `Grommet` and `styled-system`
inspired UI System. We ended up relying fully dynamic `styled-components`,
almost completely stopped writing CSS and custom `styled-components`.

One main component was such:

```jsx
const UiBox = styled.div`
    display: flex;
    ${({ width }) => width && 'width: ${width}rem;'}
```

Of course our component had much more dynamic props and it had a lot of
custom functionality backed in. It's is really comfy and refreshing
to use such approach, but Our React tree started to look as such
while composing layouts:

```jsx
<UiBox
    pad={5}
    height={20}
    width="100%"
    direction="column"
    align="center"
    valign="center"
    background="dark-3"
    position="relative"
>
    <And more, and more />
</UiBox>
```

It started to look too much, too crowded, too cluttered. This what was
giving the first glimpse of the idea, we started to joke about using
letters instead. Actually, why not?! I started to create a sample
solution and it actually felt good. It is not like using letters as
variable names. It is almost completely the same flow as writing regular
CSS using auto-complete:

1. Press `d`
1. ~~Press `Tab` => `display`~~
1. Press `b`
1. ~~Press `Tab` => `block`~~

The letters are basically a shorthand and once you get more familiar
and comfortable with them you can get even more efficient than writing
regular CSS.

## Possible benefits

-   Smaller bundles
-   Less cluttered codebase
-   Faster development

## Examples

There are already multiple ways to utilize CCSS in your codebase,
however currently only CSS-in-JS solutions are being covered.

## Mission

There are multiple goals we're trying to achieve, both short and long
term.

We want to introduce the concept and get it validated by the community,
and provide tools for different use cases.

We also want to provide tools later to transform classic CSS
strings/objects to CCSS automatically for production builds: a Babel
Plugin and Webpack Loader for sure.

We want to add CCSS support to 3rd party design systems, CSS solutions.

Who knows, a future version of CSS8 might standardize shorthands based on
what the community builds up here.

## FAQ

### Why Cryptic?

Because it is making your CSS/React components/etc. look really _Cryptic_.

```js
ccss({
    d: 'b',
    p: 12,
    mt: 5,
    bg: 't'
})
```

### What is the approach?

The simplified answer: We have a property-map and a value-map where
we basically match the short version of their long counterpart and
emit.

### How about performance?

Transforming the shorthands at runtime has performance costs, especially
if your code is in a hot path (and usually with CSS-in-JS that's true
for all CSS). However the hit is not more than using dynamic values
in `styled-components` or using `styled-system`. We were also very
restrictive about the shipped features make the core as primitive as
possible.

### How big the size saving is?

We do not have any case studies in practice. Due to the fact the CCSS
also requires some extra code, you first need to reach the point where
`your CCSS + compiler = original CSS`. After that the saving should be
60-70% approx. This is fairly easy to reach as the compiler itself
is small.

### Won't be this hard to understand?

We think that you need relatively short time to get comfortable with it.
However we also have a focus on developer experience. We're providing
TypeScript definitions and TSDoc for all props to help your work.
You'll have nice auto-complete and a list of possible options.

### Why just not use `styled-system`?

It's not our goal to provide a tool to implement design systems nor
giving such amount of features `styled-system` does. However the mapping
approach used by CCSS is making the compiler capable of supporting
custom properties and custom values. For example it's easy to define
such:

```js
ccss({
    c: 'dark',
    size: 'large'
})
/**
 * Output:
 *
 * color: #333;
 * font-size: 32em;
 */
```
