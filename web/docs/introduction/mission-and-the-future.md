title: Mission and The Future
---

There are multiple goals we're trying to achieve, both short and long
term. We want to:

-   Introduce the concept and get it validated by the community.
-   Improve tooling for different use cases.
-   Provide tools for wider **CCSS** support and regular CSS solutions:
    -   `babel-plugin` to convert existing `styled-components` to shorthands for production codebase.
    -   `webpack-loader` to add support for converting regular CSS to CCSS.
    -   3rd party **CCSS** support for `styled-components`, `emotion`, `styled-system`, `PostCSS` and others.
    -   Ready to use design systems.

Who knows, a future version of CSS8 might standardize shorthands based on
what the community is building up here. ðŸ˜‰ It's relatively easy to implement,
standardize and it has great benefits.
